Minimal Rust Android OpenGL ES sample 

Displays spinning tori in a lisajous; derived from NDK "native-activity" sample. creates an opengl 2 context. Uses a C stub, which calls rust_android_init  .. rust_android_render;  these are #[no_mangle] extern "C" functions defined in main.rs, 
its just a quick sample, and pretty messy, but minimal.

To run: 
[1] consult android docs for how to configure the android project .. (android project update ... various options)
[2]
cd android
make

.. that should compile and deploy the project.
make in the project root should run the same rendering code on desktop.

android/jni/desktop_emu_gl.c  provides empty stub functions for linking.

PROBLEMS: many, but currently the desktop code doesn't link, its simplified from another project, the absence of certain references seems to preclude it linking gl ??
